<h2 align="center"> My name is Lisa and I am an entry Level Web Developer with strong communication skills</h2>

- My preferred languages are English, German and Chinese (Mandarin) but if I were part of a French speaking office team I could easily adapt to that as well ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ä¸­ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·
- I just finished technical training, with a focus on React and JavaScript, but as soon as I am done with brushing up on my PostgreSQL I would love to deepen my understanding of Python and start to learn either Java or C
- I was really lucky to be placed in a group with former UX Designers for my final project {iPlant} and I am really happy with the sleek, yet colourful design of our app and the soothing dark mode
